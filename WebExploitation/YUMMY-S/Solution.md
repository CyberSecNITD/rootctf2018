The problem statement was clearly saying that some bits of A cookie are stealed . There are three cookies set in your browser and a ```DB``` is given . Obviously Bruteforcing ```Name``` and ```Group``` is meaningless as there are infinite possibilities but if you closely look at the ```Epoch time``` in the Database you will observe that the number of Bits(convert it to Binary) are 8 more than that of the epoch time cookie stored in your broswer. That's it !! You just need to bruteforce those 8 Bits (only 256 different possibilities). PS:- Don't forget the format(it's base64 XD) !
# Have a look at the solution ```test.py```
