First of All, by inspecting the source you would find a hidden button . The button would be giving you an endpoint ```/code``` but visiting that endpoint you will get nothing apart form a message "Nice try kiddo" . By looking at the main page closely there's a hint that "Americans doesn't stand a chance" , so let's try with Russia's IP(2.60.X.X or check this https://www.nirsoft.net/countryip/ru.html) using ```X-Forwarded-For``` Header .
# curl 'http://localhost:1337/code' -H 'X-Forwarded-For: 2.60.0.0'
This Simple Get request will fetch you the flag:- ```rootctf(1s_b3c0m1ng_a_russ1an_C1t1z3n_d1ff1cult)```
